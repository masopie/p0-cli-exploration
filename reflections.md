# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I was a few paragraphs (and over five minutes) into the first link, "The Power of Meditation," before I realized I had neither A) any idea how long this one article was or B) exactly how many articles I could look at within the hour limit suggested by this challenge. I've already read a good deal of beginner information on meditation and wanted to get a taste of the other methods and I realized I was already improperly managing my time. Implicit in every link I skimmed was some form of the concept of "time boxing," or cordoning off pieces of your time wherein you focus utterly on one task. Or, not even a task or accomplishment, just a habit. After all, a grown habit is just a series of accomplishments waiting to happen. The two ideas that grabbed and shook me off the bat, though, were "counter-intuitive productivity" and "making it big by starting small." My current strategy is the same one I had in college and the same I have at work: just try to get it done. No method and a constant view of each project as a whole. Of course it will barely (read: doesn't) work: stress becomes the main product, satisfactory results are just a byproduct and feel accidental. I've decided to employ suggestions from both articles I mentioned above. I even, in reflection, began with a goal I didn't realize I had but was crying to be recognized and keep my mind clear: <i>do this in under an hour.</i> But how? You already have your basic Pomodoro Technique (1 hour total, or approximately a coupla tomatoes!). Figure out how long you have for each article (5 minutes, tops, for up to 10 of the 12, leaving 10 minutes to type this and any extra time to research further). Then: type. <b>Don't delay.</b>

Repeating this process, focusing on the small (an hour really is such a small increment!) and not getting lost in the big. <i>Giving yourself less time so time is more valuable and making things painful to not do.</i> These more abstract ideas, combined with adding time boxing techniques to my life, is my plan to manage Phase 0.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

As I understand it, "shell" is basically another word for an interface. Bash is the OSX/Linux interface (vs Powershell/cmd.exe for Windows) for interpreting command line instruction to your Unix shell or... hm... maybe it's just interpreting to your processor. Or maybe your processor inherently uses Unix. My mind is boggling a bit about that part. 

The most challenging thing was synthesizing more than 2-3 concepts at a time and trying to use the together. However, other redirection/piping, I succeeded in using each. The most important commands must surely be ones that can execute processes much more simply than in the GUI.

Off the top of my head (avoiding my notes), the following variables are:

- pwd - print working directory (your present location path)

- ls - show present directory's contents

- mv - move one file to another directory

- cd - go to this directory

- ../ - go back (up higher) one directory

- touch - create new empty file

- mkdir - create new directory

- less - view a file or directory's contents in a page-flippable format

- rmdir - delete directory

- rm - delete file

- help - get helpful suggestions! like "man" i suppose

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Creating & Forking a repo!

1. Create new / log into existing GitHub credentials

2. To create a new repo, simply go to your profile page by clicking Your Profile from the upper-right dropdown, click Repositories, and click the bright green New button. Name & describe your repository, decide whether it's public or private, and click Create! Who even cares about license info!

3. To fork a repo, find the master/original branch. You can use a variety of search methods, including either going through the owner's account or searching directly for the master repo. Then, just click the Fork icon on the upper right and select your username.

4. Clone a repo to your computer (after having forked a branch to your GitHub account!) by first opening your command line shell (likely Terminal with Bash in it). Find or make a directory within your Phase 0 directory where you can keep your various repos using the commands we learned in the earlier CLI challenge. Once there, type "git clone <URL>" where <URL> is the link to your newly forked repo (omit the <>'s). Voila, cloned!

Forking a repository is preferable to creating a new one as it takes exactly what appears in the master without room for error in reproduction.



My main struggles setting up git & GitHub was the learning of new commands and the navigation, respectively. In GitHub, as with any new website layout, instinct from other "social whatever" pages from an old (or differently purposed) one does not match the new one. Having a silly, simple Tumblr page, even if you edit a teenie little bit of HTML on there, won't help you get a good navigational understanding of GitHub in mere moments! :)
